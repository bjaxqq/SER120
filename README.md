### Course Description
This course will focus on introductory and intermediate topics in Java programming language along with Object Oriented programming constructs.

The topics include:
- Java Primitives,
- JDK,
- JRE,
- I/O in Java,
- Operators,
- Classes & Objects,
- Methods,
- Strings,
- Control Statements,
- Arrays,
- Arraylists,
- Inheritance,
- Exception Handling,
- Polymorphism,
- UML,
- Graphics (JavaFX).

During this course, students will work on programming constructs and practices in Java along with Object Oriented approach. They would be able to understand and implement solutions to a wide range of problems and the concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction. Please note that self-reading of several sections of the textbook is highly recommended. I believe in class discussion, so everybody is encouraged to participate. I would also like to hear your input and ideas for improving the presentation and your performance. Please feel free to discuss with me your concerns and suggestions.

Here are some useful points you should remember to improve your understanding and performance in the course.
- Read little but contemplate more.
- Every day you should spend at least one hour to review & revise the course material covered in the class.
- Make a list of your questions you would like to ask the instructor.
- Do not confine only to the textbook and lecture notes. You should consult other reference books to improve your understanding of the material. Useful information can be found on many educational web sites.
- You should try to do the problems given in the book. Try to answer them to the best of your knowledge. If you do not have the answer, then go back and read the chapter again. Even after this if you are unable to get the answer, then discuss with your colleagues If all fails, then you are welcome to bring your problems to me.
- Try to rectify your mistakes of last homework and tests.
- Be always on time (a) in the class, (b) in submitting your homework, and (c) taking your test.
- Finally, try not to be afraid of tests or homework. Work on them with confidence.

In a nutshell, this is a fast-paced course but not a self-paced course. You will need to keep up. Because of the nature of this course not being self-paced, you can get behind quickly, so it's important to stay on schedule and spread the work for each week out over several days. Block out time to work on the class and don't try to make a big push at the deadline. In general, students who try to do a lot close to the deadline do not learn as much or score as well.

### Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:
- Analyze, design, and implement software applications using OOP techniques.
    - Use UML class diagrams for designing OO Java applications.
    - Use OOP concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inherence and polymorphism during design and development.
    - Explain a subset of design patterns and use patterns during design and development
- Design and develop event-driven graphical java applications.
- Use advanced java APIs and collections.

### Grading
- Assignments: 30%
    - There will be a graded online assignment due approximately every 3 weeks (with tentative due date: 5:00 PM, Friday). Late submissions are not accepted. The only exception is on my discretion based on medical emergencies for which youâ€™d have to submit proper documentation preferably before the deadline or within 24 hours of the deadline. If an extension is granted then such requests can only be made for up to 1 extra day, anything more than that would not be permitted. Remember that failure to request and get pre-approval for an extension would be treated as no extension. No late submissions are accepted unless otherwise approved by the instructor.
- Quizzes: 30%
    - There will be a short online quiz on blackboard during lecture time, every 1-2 weeks.
- Tests: 20%
    - There will be a mid-term online test (10%) and a final online test (10%).
- Attendance: 10%
- Final Team Project: 10%
    - There will be a final team project (team of 2) due towards the end of the course.
