# Lesson 14

### Topics
- Exception handling review
- Forwarding exception: the keyword “throws”
- Generating exception: the keyword “throw”
- “throw” as a superset of “throws” in terms of code functionality

### Learning Objectives
- Discuss the scope of “throw” for generating an exception, and explain why one should use it and when.
- Discuss the scope of “throws” for forwarding an exception and explain why one should use it and when.
- Demonstrate the use of “throw” and “throws” in a java program.

### Review
- Chapter 8 from Slide# 1 up to end.

# Lesson 15

### Topics
- Inheritance: what is it? Super/Base/Parent and Sub/Derived/Child classes.
- Single
- Multi-level
- Multiple
- Aggregation Vs. Inheritance: “has a” relationship Vs. “is a” relationship.
- Derived class essentially being “Base + Derived” including data and methods.
- The keyword “extends” to inherit a class
- Using `super.<base class method>` to call the base class version of a method as needed.
- Using `super(...)` to call the base class constructors as needed.

### Learning Objectives
- Discuss the scope of inheritance and its different forms.
- Discuss the relationship between classes in case of aggregation vs. inheritance.
- Demonstrate inheritance between 2 or more classes in single or multi-level form using the keyword “extends”.
- Show how to call a base class method from a derived class method using the keyword “super”. Explain how method search happens in a “bottom-up” fashion in inheritance hierarchy.
- Show how to call a base class constructor from a derived class constructor using the keyword “super”. Explain how construction of the object happens in a “top-down” fashion in inheritance hierarchy.
