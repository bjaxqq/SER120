# Lesson 5

### Topics
- “this” reference
- Default Initial Values of instance data
- Constructors
- UML for class, instance data & methods

### Learning Objectives
- Explain what a Constructor is and why is it required in Java Classes.
- Demonstrate the use of Constructors.
- Discuss what is “this” reference and why is it required in every instance method.

### Review
- Chapter 3 from Slide# 44 until the end.

# Lesson 6

### Topics
- Method Signature in Java.
- Polymorphism in simple methods: method overloading.
- Static data & methods.
- Randomization: using Random number generator.
- Basic “while” loops: repetition, and UML diagram.
- UML drawing online resources.

- Class practice:
    Problem Description:
    
    Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance variables—a part number (type String), a part description (type String), a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double).
    
    Your class should have two overloaded constructors: one as zero argument constructor and the other as a 4-argument constructor, for initializing the instance variables.
    
    Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0.
    
    Write a test application named InvoiceTest (a driver class) that demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities. Try and demonstrate use of all the constructors & methods in the class. Take print screen of the output of the driver class.
    
    Draw UML diagrams for the class, and activity diagram for the method getInvoiceAmount.
### Learning Objectives
- Explain the signature of any method in Java.
- Discuss and demonstrate polymorphism using method overloading in instance methods and constructors.
- Discuss the importance of “static” data and methods in a class. Show how these are different than “instance” data and methods.
- Draw UML class diagrams for Java class and UML activity diagrams for “if-else” constructs and its variations and “while” loop.
