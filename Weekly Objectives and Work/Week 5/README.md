# Lesson 7

### Topics
- Review if-else construct:
    
    Implement a program that reads points (out of 100) in 5 courses, calculates the average, and prints the grade based on the scale as shown below:

    | Grade Range (%) | Grade |
    | :--: | :--: |
    | 93.00 - 100 | A |
    | 90.00 - 92.99 | A- |
    | 87.00 - 89.99 | B+ |
    | 83.00 - 86.99 | B |
    | 80.00 - 82.99 | B- |
    | 77.00 - 79.99 | C+ |
    | 73.00 - 76.99 | C |
    | 70.00 - 72.99 | C- |
    | 60.00 - 69.99 | D |
    | < 60 | F |

- Conditional operator- “condition ? statement1 : statement 2”
- Counter-controlled loop Vs. Sentinel-controlled loop
- Typecasting: narrowing Vs. widening
- Increment & Decrement operators: prefix Vs. postfix
- Peer grading: refer handout for more detail

### Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate the use of conditions and their variations in if-else.
- Explain and show the use of conditional operators (with and without nesting).
- Show the implementation of typecasting and discuss the needs for such a construct.
- Discuss the workings of a counter-controlled loop vs. a sentinel-controlled loop.
- Show the variations and distinct features of increment and decrement operators.

### Review
- Chapter 4 from Slide# 75 until the end.

# Lesson 8

### Topics
- The “math” class from lang package (helper methods like ceil, floor, pow, sqrt, sin …)
- for and do-while loops
- “break” & “continue” in while loop
- “return” statement: returning singular vs. multiple values from a method
- Logical operators: “&&”, “||” and “!”
- Class exercise:

    Write a program to find the value of e for (n is an input given by user):

    $e^x=1+\frac{x^1}{1!}+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}\cdots$ up to $n$ terms

### Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate the use of static helper methods coming from math class.
- Explain and show the use of “break” and “continue” keywords in loops.
- Show the implementation of odd loop (like do-while) and counting loop (like for) and discuss the needs for such a construct.
- Discuss and show the limitations of “return” in context of a method, and how can it be overcome.
- Enumerate and then demonstrate the conditions/situations for the use of logical operators.

### Review
- Chapter 5 from up to Slide# 52.
