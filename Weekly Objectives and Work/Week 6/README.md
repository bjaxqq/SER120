# Lesson 9

### Topics
- “char” type in Java
- switch-case-default statement
- Use random number generation for roll of a fair six-sided die to demonstrate probability distribution
- “return” statement: returning singular vs. multiple values from a method
- Logical operators: “&&”, “||” and “!”
- Use of “break”: program to find if a number ‘$n$’ is prime or not [loop from 2 to $sqrt{n}$]

### Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate the implementation of switch-case-default statement.
- Discuss and show the limitations of “return” in context of a method, and how can it be overcome.
- Enumerate and then demonstrate the conditions/situations for the use of logical operators.
