# Lesson 18

### Topics
- Polymorphism: polymorphic behavior – program in general rather than program in the specific
- Polymorphic examples: Animal::move () <- Frog, Bird, Fish, Kangaroo.
- Superclass variable with a reference to subclass object: dynamic binding/late binding
- Early/Static binding: final method can’t be overridden. Private methods are implicitly final.
- Polymorphism with exceptions: single catch block with Exception argument.

### Learning Objectives
- Discuss and demonstrate the polymorphic behavior when you assign a subclass object to a superclass variable.
- Explain why it is not best practice to use one catch block that uses Exception object but to have multiple catch blocks for different types of potential exceptions.
- Show that final methods of a class cannot be overridden. Explain you answer.
