# Lesson 16

### Topics
- Constructors: super () Vs. this ()
- Access specifiers: protected Vs. private
- Why Inheritance? Reusability/Extension/Addition/Modification
- @Override
- Using a class: Objects Vs. Inheritance. The classes that can’t be inherited
- Design a Shape2D class with data: height and width
- Shape2D as abstract class with draw, getArea, getPerimeter.

### Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate the difference between calling constructors using “this” Vs. “super”. Discuss their application scopes.
- Explain the access specifier “protected” and how is it different than “private” or “public”. Using a code example discuss how “protected” can be avoided using a properly designed class, setters/getters and “super”.
- Discuss the need and benefits of using Inheritance using the idea of reusability, extension, addition, and modification.
- Demonstrate what are final classes and why do we need them.
- Explain what “abstract” classes are, their effects and what are the requirements for a class to be “abstract”. Differentiate between the need and scope of “abstract” Vs. “concrete” classes.
- Demonstrate any three scenarios where “abstract” classes are ideal to be used, also provide java code for these classes.

### Review
- Chapter 9 from Slide# 19 up to end.

# Lesson 17

### Topics:
- Discussion on Shape2D class with data: height and width.
- Sub classes of Shape2D: Rectangle, Circle, Triangle
- Shape2D as abstract class: with draw, getArea, getPerimeter.
- Shape2D as an interface.
- Java abstract class Vs. Java interface: Use cases, pros/cons, features, applications.

### Learning Objectives
- Discuss inheritance as a bottom-up approach Vs. object construction in inheritance is top-down.
- Explain the idea behind abstract classes and abstract methods. What is the purpose of creating an abstract class since it can’t be instantiated? What are the rules imposed on its sub-classes?
- Elaborate on the need and benefits of using Interfaces in Java. What is the scope and limitations of Interfaces?
- Provide use cases when Interfaces must be preferred over Abstract classes, and vice versa.
- Explain the keywords “extends” and “implements”. Which of them works with Abstract classes or Interfaces, and why?
- Design and demonstrate extension with abstract class and implementation with Interfaces.

### Review
- Chapter 10.
