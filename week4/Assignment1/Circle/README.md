# Circle

### Instructions
Develop a class Circle with a private member variable “radius” as a double. It also has “PI” as a static private constant. Write proper setters and getters for this class. Also write a function “getArea” that would return the area of the circle. The area of Circle is calculated as PI * radius * radius.

    i. Add a default constructor
    ii. Add an overloaded constructor to initialize radius to a user supplied value
    iii. In your main function, demonstrate how you would you call default constructor and argumented constructor, print the area for each
    iv. In your main function, create an array of 5 Circle objects (it’d call default constructor)
    v. In your main function, create an array of 5 Circle objects and initialize radius for each as: 12, 7, 9, 14, 18
    vi. In your main function, run a look that displays area for each of the 5 objects you created in “1.v”
