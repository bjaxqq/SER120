# Week 12

### Topics:
* Constructors: super () Vs. this ()
* Access specifiers: protected Vs. private
* Why Inheritance? Reusability/Extension/Addition/Modification
* @Override
* Using a class: Objects Vs. Inheritance. The classes that can’t be inherited
* Design a Shape2D class with data: height and width
* Shape2D as abstract class with draw, getArea, getPerimeter.

### Learning Objectives:
* Demonstrate the difference between calling constructors using “this” Vs. “super”. Discuss their application scopes.
* Explain the access specifier “protected” and how is it different than “private” or “public”. Using a code example discuss how “protected” can be avoided using a properly designed class, setters/getters and “super”.
* Discuss the need and benefits of using Inheritance using the idea of reusability, extension, addition, and modification.
* Demonstrate what are final classes and why do we need them.
* Explain what “abstract” classes are, their effects and what are the requirements for a class to be “abstract”. Differentiate between the need and scope of “abstract” Vs. “concrete” classes.
* Demonstrate any three scenarios where “abstract” classes are ideal to be used, also provide java code for these classes.

### Review:
* Chapter 9 from Slide# 19 up to end.
