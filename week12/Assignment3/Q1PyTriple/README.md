# Pythagorean Triples

### Instructions
A right triangle can have sides whose lengths are all integers. The set of three integer values for the lengths of the sides of a right triangle is called a Pythagorean triple. The lengths of the three sides must satisfy the relationship
that the sum of the squares of two of the sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Write an application that displays a table of the Pythagorean triples for side1, side2 and the hypotenuse, all no larger than 500. You’d need to use “field-width specifiers” to print the output that is formatted to look like a table. Use a triple-nested for loop that tries all possibilities. This method is an example of “brute-force” computing. You’ll learn in more advanced computer science courses that for many interesting problems there’s no known algorithmic approach other than using sheer brute force.
