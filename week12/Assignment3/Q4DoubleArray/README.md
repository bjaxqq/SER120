# Array Initializer

### Instructions
Write a segment of code that will declare an array of doubles that can hold ‘N’ elements. N must be a properly declared ‘int’ constant. Then, initialize the array so that each element of the array contains the square root of its position. Use the method: static double sqrt (double) from java.lang.Math to compute the square roots. You must also make sure that the program handles the exceptions as well. (Hint: Show the use of try-catch too)
