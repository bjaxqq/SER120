# Reverse List

### Instructions
Write a method that reverses the order of elements in an ArrayList<E> without creating a new ArrayList. You may only use the methods remove, add, and size. (For this problem you could use ArrayList<Integer> or ArrayList<String>). Demonstrate the working of your method by calling it from the main a few times.
