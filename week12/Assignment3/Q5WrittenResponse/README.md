### Instructions
Using 2 examples each for Inheritance, Aggregation and Composition, discuss the appropriate situations for Using Inheritance vs. Using Composition vs. Using Aggregation. Your examples must be distinct and based on the real world. You can find motivation by thinking “if you were implementing an idea as a class, which one of the above would you use and why”. Remember that a class is just an imitation of real-world objects. Submit your discussion, no code required but you are encouraged to use pseudo-code to support your examples. (In 500 words max).
