# Collatz Conjecture

### Assignment:
* Create a program that prints the Collatz Conjecture for a number "n" (or all the numbers from 3 through n), counts how many steps it took to get to 1, and also counts how many primes were encountered.
* Example: The output for the number 9 would be 9 -> 28 -> 14 -> 7 -> 22 -> 11 -> 34 -> 17 -> 52 -> 26 -> 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.
