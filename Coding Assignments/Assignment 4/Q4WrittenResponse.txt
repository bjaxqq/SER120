- The four card suits are represented by the program's representation of a deck of playing cards. 
- The software uses a GUI that shows the cards using Swing. 
- Arrays of Card objects are used to represent the deck of cards; each Card object contains a face, suit, and image attribute. 
- The four suits are shown in a grid format in a window that is made possible by the CardDisplay class, which extends JFrame. 
- Using a JLabel component and an ImageIcon, each suit is shown. 
- The software uses a CardDisplayMouseClicks object to change the image displayed to a randomly chosen card from the appropriate deck of cards when the user clicks on a suit.

Algorithm:

- Create the Card class that has face, suit, and image properties.
- Create the CardDisplay class that extends JFrame.

In CardDisplay constructor:
- Define face and suit arrays.
- Populate four decks of cards with Card objects.
- Set GridLayout of JFrame to 1x4.
- Set size of JFrame to 1400x500.
- Call createCardPanels method.
- Set JFrame to visible.

In createCardPanels method:
- Create JLabel components for each suit.
- Create ImageIcon for each suit using image of first card in respective deck.
- Set icon of JLabels to respective ImageIcon.
- Add JLabels to JFrame.
- Add MouseListener to JLabels using CardDisplayMouseClicks object.

- Create CardDisplayMouseClicks class that extends MouseAdapter.

In the CardDisplayMouseClicks constructor:
- Set deck and imageLabel properties.

Override mouseClicked method to:
- Get random integer nextCard between 0 and 12.
- Set icon of imageLabel to image of card at index nextCard in respective deck.

The program flow is as follows:
- The main method in the CardDisplayTest class is called.
- A new CardDisplay object is created, which creates a JFrame window with four JLabel components.
- The createCardPanels method is called, which adds the JLabel components to the JFrame and sets a MouseListener to each one using a CardDisplayMouseClicks object.
- The mouseClicked method of the CardDisplayMouseClicks object is called when a user clicks on a JLabel.
- A random integer is generated, and the image of the card at the respective index is displayed.
